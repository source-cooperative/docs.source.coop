Note: creating an account does not automatically allow you to add data to repositories. If you want to upload data, please send a message to hello@source.coop and let us know your user name and what kind of data you would like to publish. If we can publish your data, we will give you permission to add repositories (you can find instructions to add repositories [here]({{< ref "/docs/web-ui/repositories" >}}).

## Creating an account for an organization

If you would like to create a profile for your organization (like https://beta.source.coop/nasa), please write us at hello@source.coop and let us know about your organization. If we can create a profile for your organization, we will link it to your individual account, allowing you to create repositories at `https://beta.source.coop/{organization-id}/{repository-id}` as well as `https://beta.source.coop/{username}/{repository-id}`.
