# Source Viewers

## Introduction

Source Viewers are views into files served over HTTP intended to enable quick and easy exploration of data through your web browser. The Source Viewers library contains a collection of React components which define the file types that they are compatible with. Similar to your operating systemâ€™s file explorer, the Source Viewer allows you to open a file in all viewers which are compatible with that file type.
