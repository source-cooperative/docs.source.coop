## Sharing code examples

### Store code examples in a separate directories
Store examples, such as notebooks or scripts, in a subdirectory of the root directory (e.g., `~/examples/`). This makes it easy for users to find and use the examples.

### Sensitive Information
Ensure that notebooks or scripts do not include any sensitive information, such as credentials or personal data. This helps protect the privacy and security of the data and the users.
