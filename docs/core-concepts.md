# Core Concepts

Source is a data publishing utility designed to make data shared in object stores easier to find, explore, and share on the web.

## Overview

The best way to summarize Source is that it allows individuals or organizations to publish files to the web, collected in repositories. Every repository is owned by either an individual or an organization. A repository has a title and description, can contain any number of files (or objects), and can contain a README file.

## Repositories

Repositories are the primary organizational unit in Source. They serve as containers for related data files and provide a way to group and organize information logically.

### Repository Structure
- **Title**: A descriptive name for the repository
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of what the repository contains
- **Owner**: Either an individual or an organization
- **Files**: Any number of data objects can be stored within a repository
- **README**: An optional markdown file that provides additional context and documentation

### Repository Features
- **Public Access**: All repositories are publicly accessible via HTTP
- **Unlisted Repositories**: While all repositories are publicly accessible, users can opt to leave them unlisted to prevent them from appearing in search results or lists of repositories on the Source website
- **Web Interface**: Each repository has a dedicated web page for browsing and exploring

### Future Respository Features
- **Restricted Access**: The ability to restrict repository access based on identity and access rules
- **Repository Monetization**: The ability to charge for access to repositories
- **Versioning**: Support for tracking changes made to repositories

## Objects

Objects are the individual files or data items stored within repositories. They represent the actual data that users want to access and analyze.

### Object Characteristics
- **File Types**: Support for any file format (CSV, JSON, images, documents, etc.)
- **Size**: No practical limits on file size
- **Direct Access**: Objects can be accessed directly via HTTP URLs
- **Organization**: Objects can be organized in folders or with descriptive naming

## Individuals

Individuals can own and manage repositories on Source, making it easy for researchers, data scientists, and other professionals to share their work.

### Individual Accounts
- **Profile**: Each individual has a profile page showcasing their repositories
- **Ownership**: Individuals can own multiple repositories
- **Collaboration**: Individuals can collaborate with organizations on shared repositories
- **Attribution**: Clear attribution for data contributions and ownership

### Individual Benefits
- **Easy Publishing**: Simple tools for publishing data without technical infrastructure
- **Professional Presence**: Establish a professional presence in the data community
- **Collaboration**: Connect with other data publishers and users
- **Impact**: Increase the visibility and impact of research and data work

## Organizations

Organizations can use Source to establish a structured approach to data publishing, making their data assets more discoverable and accessible.

### Organization Features
- **Branded Presence**: Organizations have branded profile pages
- **Team Management**: Multiple individuals can contribute to organization repositories
- **Governance**: Organizational policies and standards can be applied to data publishing
- **Analytics**: Insights into data usage and impact

### Organization Benefits
- **Data Strategy**: Implement a comprehensive data publishing strategy
- **Compliance**: Meet open data requirements and transparency goals
- **Engagement**: Increase engagement with stakeholders and the public
- **Efficiency**: Streamline data sharing processes without maintaining custom infrastructure

## Key Principles

### Open Access
All data published through Source is publicly accessible, promoting transparency and collaboration.

### Simplicity
Source eliminates the complexity of building custom data portals or APIs, making data publishing accessible to everyone.

### Standards-Based
Source leverages existing web standards and object storage protocols, ensuring compatibility and longevity.

### Community-Driven
Source fosters a community of data publishers and users, creating opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing.
